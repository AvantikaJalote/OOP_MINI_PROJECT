# OOP_MINI_PROJECT

Many society applications are not good enough because they lack proper orientation. Even the data is cluttered so we need to come up with a portal that is one-stop for all. Our society management project helps the user to execute simple yet time-consuming tasks by just one click of the finger. Our project is designed in a simplistic manner which is user-friendly. It allows the user to browse various functions of society such as accessing the clubhouse, booking a hall, and the most important one- to raise a complaint ,if any. We also have a functionality which stores the front gate delivery records . These records can be displayed later or as and when required. As mentioned earlier, in the clubhouse, the user can pick their favourite sports amenities for which is present in the society. Now, to maintain these clubhouse amenities , the society needs maintenance staff. Clubhouse also stores the check in and check out timings of the staff. Our hall management function allows residents and non-residents to book the halls for various time durations at different prices. The most important function of our society management system is the query function. Through this, the residents can access the contact details of the staff they need. This staff data includes contact information of maids, plumbers and electricians. Query module also lets all the users file a complaint regarding society management, if any. All of this is simply coded in c++.
